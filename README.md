# Shift Taker
A project shift board made for a store to "swap" shifts. Based in ReactJS and Firebase back end to store current shifts and taken shifts. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Firebase
This project utilizes firebase to connect and share information with other authorized users on the platform.
Currently, users can take and post shifts by email and the information will be stored until an authorized individual clears the list of shifts. This email can be changed.
